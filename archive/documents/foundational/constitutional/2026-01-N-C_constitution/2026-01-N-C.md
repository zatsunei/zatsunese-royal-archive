   > „I, [NAME], do hereby pledge my allegiance to the Constitution of the Kingdom of Zatsunei, to defend it and the sovereignty of the Kingdom. I shall act in the best interests of the people and uphold the values of Zatsunei. I will never use my position to satisfy personal self-interests or hunger for power, but to faithfully represent my Kingdom, which was created for all the Zatsunese.

A national emergency may be declared only if the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Zatsunei is threatened, a disaster affecting the people or environment occurs, or a major issue arises that requires immediate action to protect the Kingdom. During a national emergency, the Sovereign shall exercise the full and absolute authority necessary to resolve the situation and protect the Kingdom and its people.

<h2 align="center">CHAPTER VIII. ― Impeachment and Votes of No Confidence</h2>

#### Article 1. ― Impeachments
1. Impeachment is the formal constitutional process by which a public officeholder may be accused of grave violations of the Constitution or law. Impeachment initiates a judicial proceeding before the Royal Supreme Court of Justice, which determines whether the official shall be removed from office or disqualified.

2. The grounds for impeachment shall be grave violations of the Constitution or law, corruption or abuse of office, proven incapacity or ineptitude, and repeated misconduct or mental incapacity.

3. The Royal Parliament shall have the sole power of impeachment. Impeachment may be initiated by either the House of Representatives with a simple majority vote or the Royal Senate with a two-thirds super-majority vote.

4. Public officeholders subject to impeachment shall include the Chief Governor, members of the Royal Cabinet, members of the Royal Parliament, including Governors and Lieutenant Governors, all judges of the judiciary, and any other positions designated as impeachable by this Constitution or by law.

5. Following a successful vote to impeach by either chamber of the Royal Parliament, the public officeholder shall be formally accused and charged. The officeholder may be temporarily suspended from office only when authorized by the Royal Supreme Court of Justice or Sovereign, or as otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law.

6. The Royal Supreme Court of Justice shall be the sole organ to try all impeachments. During the trial, the public officeholder and all relevant parties shall be heard, evidence shall be reviewed, judges with a conflict shall be recused, and the officeholder shall have the right to counsel, to defend themselves, and to challenge all evidence and testimony.

7. All evidence must be clear and convincing. If it is evident beyond reasonable doubt that a public officeholder committed acts meeting the grounds for impeachment, the Supreme Court shall consider this sufficient to support the accusation and trial.

8. Following the conclusion of a fair trial, the judges of the Royal Supreme Court of Justice shall issue a verdict and, where the required threshold is met, convict the public officeholder. The process for issuing verdicts and convictions shall follow the rules established in Chapter VII, Article 11.

9. Upon conviction in an impeachment trial, the public officeholder shall be removed from office, disqualified from holding the same or any other public office, or both. No other penalties shall be imposed through impeachment. The officeholder may additionally be prosecuted in a court for any criminal acts related to the impeachment.

#### Article 2. ― Votes of No Confidence
1. A vote of no confidence shall be the formal political process by which a chamber of the Royal Parliament expresses that it no longer supports a public officeholder of the executive, including the Chief Governor, and may lead to the resignation or removal of that officeholder in accordance with this Constitution. The Sovereign shall be exempt from the vote of no confidence.

2. A vote of no confidence may be initiated by either chamber of the Royal Parliament when one or more public officeholders of the executive are affected. A vote shall be considered successful if it receives a simple majority in the House of Representatives or a two-thirds super-majority in the Royal Senate.

3. Following a successful vote of no confidence, the Sovereign shall have the authority to determine whether the affected officeholder shall resign and be removed. The Sovereign may decline to enforce the resignation and removal, if doing so is necessary to maintain stability or the proper functioning of the Government, if the Royal Parliament has not proposed an eligible replacement, or if enforcement would conflict with this Constitution or the law.

4. A vote of no confidence shall not automatically issue impeachment.
